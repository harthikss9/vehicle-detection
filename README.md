Vehicle Detection using Transfer Learning - Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50

This project implements an object detection pipeline using Transfer Learning to detect cars, medium trucks, and large trucks in images. The model is built using Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone, fine-tuned on a custom dataset with 14,000 training images and 2,000 validation images.
